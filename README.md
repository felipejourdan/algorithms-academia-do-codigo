Instructions
Create pseudocode for every algorithm, and only then proceed to implement the solution in JavaScript.

Use two files: one for pseudocode solutions and one for JavaScript implementations. Submit the files containing solutions for every problem. The JavaScript file must contain functions that return values.

You must complete the first four exercises. The fifth is optional, but we recommend you consider a possible pseudocode solution.

Test your code with all the edge cases you might think of. When you are out of ideas, check the toggle list below each exercise and test some ideas.

Sorting Algorithm
Given a list of numbers, [100, 95, 10, -10, 32, -55, 44, 10, 33, -564] sort them using an insertion sort and a selection sort. The output should be a sorted array. You must create two separate functions for each sorting algorithm.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list which add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded has no digits and consists solely of characters and special symbols. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return true if the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example:

Given the string "([])", return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", return false.
